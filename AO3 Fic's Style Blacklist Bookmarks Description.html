<h3>AO3: Fic's Style, Blacklist, Bookmarks</h3>

<h4>Fic's Style</h4>
<ul>
<li>Text is justified.</li>
<li>Empty paragraphs and multiple line breaks are hidden.</li>
<li><strong>Symbols</strong>:<br>&laquo; : select previous font<br>&raquo; : select next font<br>- : decrease font size<br>+ : increase font size<br>&#9643; : decrease page's width<br>&#9633; : increase page's width<br>&#9642; : change background and font color<br>r : reset changes to default<br>&#9776; : show/hide menu</li>
<li>The <strong>estimated reading time</strong> for each chapter and the entire fanfiction is calculated based on the 200 words per minute reading average.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Blacklist</h4>
<ul>
<li>When searching you can hide works that contain certain <b>tags</b> (ratings, warnings, relationships, characters, freeforms, bookmarker's tags, fandoms).</li>
<li>The Blacklist appears only on pages that contain a list of fanfictions.</li>
<li>You can completely hide blacklisted works or show the reasons why they're blacklisted.</li>
<li>You can pause the blacklist.</li>
<li>Use a <b>comma</b> to separate the tags you want to hide.<br><small><i>Example:</i> drabble, gun violence, teen and up audiences</small></li>
<li>Use <b>*</b> for wildcards. <small><i>Example:</i><br>*fluff* (tags containing 'fluff')<br>*fluff (tags ending with 'fluff')<br>fluff* (tags starting with 'fluff')<br>*magic* au (tags starting with whatever, containing 'magic' in the middle and ending with a white space plus 'au')<br>and every other combination</small></li>
<li>Use <b>&&</b> to hide works that contains a pair of words, it will match any tag that contains at least the pair.<br><small><i>Example:</i> hermione&&snape, potter&&tom riddle, original*character&&/<br>(it can be used only once in the same tag, one&&two&&three or more won't work)</small></li>
<li>Use <b>&!</b> to hide works with romantic relationships that include only one person of your favourite ship.<br><small><i>Example:</i> harry potter&!draco malfoy (it hides all works that contain these two characters in other romantic relationships)</small></li>
<li>You can hide works that have too many <b>relationships</b>, <b>fandoms</b>, <b>chapters</b> and/or <b>incompleted</b> works that have been last updated <i>some</i> months ago. To disable the options put 0 (zero) or leave them empty.</li>
<li>You can hide works that aren't in your specified <b>languages</b>. To disable the option leave it empty.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bookmarks / Full Screen</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can save the reading position for later.</li>
<li>To create a new bookmark, you first have to open the Full Screen.</li>
<li>To continue reading from a bookmark, click on the fanfiction's title you want to continue in the Bookmarks menu on top, then on "Go to Bookmark".</li>
<li><strong>Symbols</strong> (in Full Screen):<br>^ : to the top<br>+ : set new bookmark<br>x : delete bookmark</li>
<li><i>Important</i>: The bookmarks are the position of the scrollbar when you click the "+" on the left. They are saved in percent, so if you change the font, size, width... they won't be totally wrong. But if you set a bookmark on the "entire work" of a still ongoing fanfiction, it's going to be saved in pixels, because if a new chapter is added the percent is going to be totally wrong, but the bookmark is going to be wrong in pixels if you change the font etc... so, <strong>advice</strong>: save the bookmark on chapters not on the entire work of a ongoing fanfiction.</li>
<li>In Full Screen summaries and notes are hidden, to read them just hover on them with the mouse.</li>
</ul>
