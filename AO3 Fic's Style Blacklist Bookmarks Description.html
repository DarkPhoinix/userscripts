<ul>
<li>Text is justified.</li>
<li>Empty paragraphs and multiple line breaks are hidden.</li>
<li>You can change different options of the <b>styling</b> of the text (see image above).</li>
<li>The menu where you can change the values only appear on the fanfiction page at the bottom right of the window (as &#9776;, click on it to open). It will change the styling when you click on save (default/ao3 font is 'inherit').</li>
<li>The <b>estimated reading time</b> for each chapter and the entire fanfiction is calculated based on the number you set for 'words per minute' (default is 250, min is 100). You can change this value in the menu (note that the new estimated reading times will appear after refreshing the page).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Blacklist</h4>

<ul>
<li>When searching you can hide works that contain certain <b>tags</b> (ratings, warnings, relationships, characters, freeforms, bookmarker's tags, fandoms).</li>
<li>The Blacklist appears only on pages that contain a list of fanfictions.</li>
<li>You can completely hide blacklisted works or show the reasons why they're blacklisted.</li>
<li>You can pause the blacklist.</li>
<li>Use a <b>comma</b> to separate the tags you want to hide.<br><small><i>Example:</i> drabble, gun violence, teen and up audiences</small></li>
<li>Use <b>*</b> for wildcards. <small><i>Example:</i><br>*fluff* (tags containing 'fluff')<br>*fluff (tags ending with 'fluff')<br>fluff* (tags starting with 'fluff')<br>*magic* au (tags starting with whatever, containing 'magic' in the middle and ending with a white space plus 'au')<br>and every other combination</small></li>
<li>Use <b>&&</b> to hide works that contains a pair of words, it will match any tag that contains at least the pair.<br><small><i>Example:</i> hermione&&snape, potter&&tom riddle, original*character&&/<br>(it can be used only once in the same tag, one&&two&&three or more won't work)</small></li>
<li>Use <b>&!</b> to hide works with romantic relationships that include only one person of your favourite ship.<br><small><i>Example:</i> harry potter&!draco malfoy (it hides all works that contain these two characters in other romantic relationships)</small></li>
<li>You can hide works that have too many <b>relationships</b>, <b>fandoms</b>, <b>chapters</b>, <b>incompleted</b> works that have been last updated <i>some months</i> ago and/or works that have too few or too many <b>words</b> (in <i>thousands</i>, so if you put "5" it refers to 5k words). To disable the options put 0 (zero) or leave them empty.</li>
<li>You can hide works that aren't in your specified <b>languages</b>. To disable the option leave it empty.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bookmarks / Full Screen</h4>

<ul>
<li>You can save the reading position for later.</li>
<li>To create a new bookmark, you first have to open the Full Screen.</li>
<li>To continue reading from a bookmark, click on the fanfiction's title you want to continue in the Bookmarks menu on top, then on "Go to Bookmark".</li>
<li><b>Symbols</b> (in Full Screen):<br>+ : set new bookmark<br>x : delete bookmark</li>
<li><i>Important</i>: The bookmarks are the position of the scrollbar when you click the "+" on the bottom left. They are saved in percent, so if you change the font, size, width... they won't be totally wrong. But if you set a bookmark on the "entire work" of a still ongoing fanfiction, it's going to be saved in pixels, because if a new chapter is added the percent is going to be totally wrong, but the bookmark is going to be wrong in pixels if you change the font etc... so, <b>advice</b>: save the bookmark on chapters not on the entire work of a ongoing fanfiction.</li>
<li>In Full Screen summaries and notes are hidden, to read them just hover on them with the mouse.</li>
</ul>
