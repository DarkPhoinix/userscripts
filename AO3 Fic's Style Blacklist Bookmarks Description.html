<ul>
   <li>Text is justified.</li>
   <li>Empty paragraphs and multiple line breaks are hidden.</li>
   <li>You can change different options of the <b>styling</b> of the text (see image above).</li>
   <li>The menu where you can change the values only appear on the fanfiction page at the bottom right of the window (as &#9776;, click on it to open). It will change the styling when you click on save (default/ao3 font is 'inherit').</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bookmarks / Full Screen</h4>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qOKKLxC.png" title="Bookmarks"><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lWckT7K.png" title="Full Screen">
<ul>
   <li>You can save the <b>reading position</b> for later.</li>
   <li>To create a new bookmark, you first have to open the Full Screen.</li>
   <li>To continue reading from a bookmark, click on the fanfiction's title you want to continue in the Bookmarks menu on top, then on "Go to Bookmark".</li>
   <li><b>Symbols</b> (in Full Screen):<br>+ : set new bookmark<br>x : delete bookmark</li>
   <li><i>Important</i>: The bookmarks are the position of the scrollbar when you click the "+" on the bottom left. They are saved in percent, so if you change the font, size, width... they won't be totally wrong. But if you set a bookmark on the "entire work" of a still ongoing fanfiction, it's going to be saved in pixels, because if a new chapter is added the percent is going to be totally wrong, but the bookmark is going to be wrong in pixels if you change the font etc... so, <b>advice</b>: save the bookmark on chapters not on the entire work of a ongoing fanfiction.</li>
   <li>In Full Screen summaries and notes are hidden, to read them just hover on them with the mouse.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Blacklist</h4>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uygBKVZ.png" title="Blacklist">
<ul>
   <li>When searching you can hide works that contain certain <b>tags</b> (ratings, warnings, relationships, characters, freeforms, bookmarker's tags, fandoms).</li>
   <li>The Blacklist appears only on pages that contain a list of fanfictions.</li>
   <li>You can completely hide blacklisted works or show the reasons why they're blacklisted.</li>
   <li>You can pause the blacklist.</li>
   <li>Use a <b>comma</b> to separate the tags you want to hide.<br><small><i>Example:</i> drabble, gun violence, teen and up audiences</small></li>
   <li>Use <b>*</b> for wildcards. <small><i>Example:</i><br>*fluff* (tags containing 'fluff')<br>*fluff (tags ending with 'fluff')<br>fluff* (tags starting with 'fluff')<br>*magic* au (tags starting with whatever, containing 'magic' in the middle and ending with a white space plus 'au')<br>and every other combination</small></li>
   <li>Use <b>&&</b> to hide works that contains a pair of words, it will match any tag that contains at least the pair.<br><small><i>Example:</i> hermione&&snape, potter&&tom riddle, original*character&&/<br>(it can be used only once in the same tag, one&&two&&three or more won't work)</small></li>
   <li>Use <b>&!</b> to hide works with romantic relationships that include only one person of your favourite ship.<br><small><i>Example:</i> harry potter&!draco malfoy (it hides all works that contain these two characters in other romantic relationships)</small></li>
   <li>You can hide works that have too many <b>relationships</b>, <b>fandoms</b>, <b>chapters</b>, <b>incompleted</b> works that have been last updated <i>some months</i> ago and/or works that have too few or too many <b>words</b> (in <i>thousands</i>, so if you put "5" it refers to 5k words). To disable the options put 0 (zero) or leave them empty.</li>
   <li>You can hide works that aren't in your specified <b>languages</b>. To disable the option leave it empty.</li>
</ul>
